The Moving Object Detection system is a computer vision-based application that detects and tracks moving objects in video streams or real-time camera feeds. It is commonly used in surveillance systems, traffic monitoring, and automation tasks where identifying motion is crucial.

Key Features:
Detects motion in real-time video or recorded footage.

Highlights or tracks moving objects with bounding boxes or contours.

Option to record or alert when motion is detected.

Adjustable sensitivity for motion detection.

Background subtraction or frame differencing methods used.

Use Cases:
Security and surveillance in restricted areas.

Monitoring traffic flow and detecting vehicle movement.

Smart home automation (e.g., turn on lights when motion is detected).

Wildlife monitoring and research.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy

Working Principle:
Capture continuous frames from a video or webcam.

Compare current frame with a reference frame or background model.

Identify differences indicating motion.

Apply image processing (blurring, thresholding, contour detection).

Highlight and optionally track moving regions.

Target Audience:
Developers working on surveillance systems.

Robotics and automation engineers.

Researchers in video analysis and motion tracking.
